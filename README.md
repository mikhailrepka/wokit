### Description

I'm happy to introduce to you my frontend toolkit, a lightweight framework called **WO Kit**, short for *Webberin One Kit*, part of my CMF/CMS platform — **Webberin One**.

WO Kit contains `css` and `js` tools to create any UI you want. All css code is built using the **atomic** philosophy, where each element is an atom, each component contains many elements, each of which can be replaced or modified. Element starts with `.__*`, modifier starts with `.--*`.

The main css file contains variables for all settings: **colors** and **sizes**. Each of the following settings is obtained by calculations from the basic variables. That's why you can scale the interface by changing a small number of variables.

### Version

Current version **0.6.0 Phase 2 (α)**
